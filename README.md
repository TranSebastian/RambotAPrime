code for the 2021-2022 vex tipping point competetion

not heavy programming, but more concept application of egineering stuff

I am not an enginner, but learning about gear ratios was fun.

Would like to make the code more adpatable. Cacluations are based on physcial properties of the robot, but adding args to the calc wouldn't be so bad.
